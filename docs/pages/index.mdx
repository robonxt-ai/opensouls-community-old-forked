# Welcome to the Soul Engine

> Like a musician imparts their soul to music, Soul Engine developers impart their soul to digital beings.

    The Soul Engine is a developer tool to *build*, *debug*, and *host* incredible experiences with AI Souls. AI souls, unlike chat-bots, exhibit personality, emotions, and agency.

    The Soul Engine is a collection of clean, simple, and extensible abstractions and APIs for directing the cognitive processes and mental state of large language models (LLMs), steamlining the creation of mind-blowing experiences.

    The Soul Engine is built on top of our open source [core library](./core.mdx). It offers multi-model (and multi-modal) access, vector search, and a variety of other APIs available as straightforward react-style hooks in your own codebase. Your code is then executed and hosted by the engine (think Vercel, and so much more, for AI souls).

1. Clone our community repository to explore example souls.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensouls/community
```

2. Run the samantha-learns soul
```bash
# then CD into the samantha-learns example soul.
cd community/souls/samantha-learns
# and npm install
npm install
# and then run samantha
npx soul-engine dev
```

Those commands will open your web browser and you can chat with Samantha. Open up the samantha-learns directory in a code editor and try customizing the soul by modifying the `Samantha.md` file.

3. Init your own soul
```bash
npx soul-engine init bob-the-millennial
```

That will create a blank soul 'Bob' and off you go creating your own experience.

## 💫 AI Souls
AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, your code gives AI souls personality, drive, ego, and agency. AI Souls interact with people (and each other) in a highly humane way, creating warm, interesting, and engaging experiences.

Folks building on the engine have creating souls that:
* bring characters from their IP to life
* interact on their discord
* are present with them in AR
* teach kids
* reside in games
* and so much more...
