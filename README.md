## 🤔 What is this?

This repository is a place for sharing knowledge on how to create AI souls. This repository holds docs, snippets, and examples for building AI souls with `@opensouls/core` and the **Soul Engine**.


If you have access to the **Soul Engine**, any soul in the repo can be run from its root directory

```bash
cd souls/example-twenty-questions
npx soul-engine dev
```

## 💫 AI Souls

AI Souls are agentic and embodied digital beings, one day comprising thousands of mental processes (managed by the Soul Engine). Unlike traditional chatbots, this code will give digital souls personality, drive, ego, and will.
