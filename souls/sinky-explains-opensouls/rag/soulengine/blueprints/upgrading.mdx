# Upgrading to @opensouls/engine

> **Note:** Read more about the new `@opensouls/core` (replacing `socialagi`) [here](/core).

This doc will cover the key information you need to upgrade your blueprints to the new engine and [`WorkingMemory`](/core/working-memory) style of blueprints.

## Differences

### Major
* There is no more CortexStep (and no more socialagi npm package). Instead, your MentalProcesses will be passed a [`WorkingMemory`](/core/working-memory) object.
* There are no more default CognitiveFunctions imported from socialagi (like externalDialog, etc). Instead, you copy and paste [`CognitiveStep`s](/core/cognitive-step) from [the community library](https://github.com/opensouls/community/tree/main/library/cognitiveSteps)
* `soul-engine` command line program now supports `install` to easily add community cognitiveSteps to your `soul/lib` directory (eg `npx soul-engine install cognitiveStep/externalDialog`)
* Your own custom CognitiveFunctions should be replaced by [`CognitiveStep`s](/core/cognitive-step)
* `socialagi` should not be used and instead everything you need is exported by `@opensouls/engine`
* In your client apps, do not import `soul-engine/soul` anymore and instead import `@opensouls/soul` (or just `@opensouls/engine` if you prefer, as soul is re-exported from there). The exports are the same and continue to work in the same manner.

### Minor
* no need for `common-tags` anymore as `indentNicely` is exported from `@opensouls/engine` and behaves the same as the old `html` tag used to.

## Example MentalProcess Upgrade

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Notice in the new WorkingMemory style that `externalDialog` is imported from a local directory. Our [community library](https://github.com/opensouls/community/tree/main/library/cognitiveSteps) has many pre-built `CognitiveStep`s
</Callout>

### Old `socialagi` style (to replace)

```ts filename="initialProcess.ts"
import { externalDialog } from "socialagi";
import { MentalProcess, useActions } from "soul-engine";

const provokesSpeaker: MentalProcess = async ({ step: initialStep }) => {
  const { speak  } = useActions()

  const { stream, nextStep } = await initialStep.next(externalDialog("Talk to the user trying to gain trust and learn about their inner world."), { stream: true, model: "gpt-4-0125-preview" });
  speak(stream);

  return nextStep
}

export default provokesSpeaker
```

### New `WorkingMemory` Style

Things to notice:
* No more `socialagi`
* `externalDialog` imported from a local directory
* `provokesSpeaker` receives a `WorkingMemory` instead of (the now deprecated) `CortexStep`
* return types from `CognitiveStep`s (`externalDialog`) are now positional Arrays instead of objects or `CortexSteps`

First, install the community `externalDialog` cognitiveStep:
```bash copy
npx soul-engine install cognitiveStep/externalDialog
```

```ts filename="initialProcess.ts" copy
import { MentalProcess, useActions } from "@opensouls/engine";
import externalDialog from "./lib/externalDialog.js";

const provokesSpeaker: MentalProcess = async ({ workingMemory }) => {
  const { speak  } = useActions()

  const [withDialog, stream] = await externalDialog(workingMemory, "Talk to the user trying to gain trust and learn about their inner world.", { stream: true, model: "gpt-4-0125-preview" });
  speak(stream);

  return withDialog;
}

export default provokesSpeaker
```

## Example custom CognitiveFunction to CognitiveStep upgrade

### Old `socialagi` style (to replace)
```ts
const userNotes = () => () => ({
  command: ({ entityName: name }: CortexStep) => {
    return html`
      Model the mind of ${name}.
      
      ## Description
      Write an updated and clear set of notes on the user that ${name} would want to remember.

      ## Rules
      * Keep descriptions as bullet points
      * Keep relevant bullet points from before
      * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
      * Do not write any notes about ${name}

      Please reply with the updated notes on the user:'
  `},
  process: (_step: CortexStep<any>, response: string) => {
    return {
      value: response,
      memories: [{
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
        content: response
      }],
    }
  }
})
```

### New `WorkingMemory` style

Things to notice:
* uses the new `createCognitiveStep` function exported from `@opensouls/engine`
* the return of the command is different now, and will return a full `Memory` and not just a string
* `html` replaced by `indentNicely`
* `postProcess` replaces `process` and has a different return type (returns a single `Memory` and the value as an `Array`)

```ts copy
import { createCognitiveStep, indentNicely } from "@opensouls/engine"

const userNotes = createCognitiveStep(() => {
  return {
    command: ({ soulName: name }: WorkingMemory) => {
      return {
        role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.System,
        content: indentNicely`
          Model the mind of ${name}.

          ## Description
          Write an updated and clear set of notes on the user that ${name} would want to remember.
        
          ## Rules
          * Keep descriptions as bullet points
          * Keep relevant bullet points from before
          * Use abbreviated language to keep the notes short
          * Do not write any notes about ${name}
        
          Please reply with the updated notes on the user:'
        `
      }
    },
    postProcess: async (_mem: WorkingMemory, response: string) => {
      return [
        {
          role: ChatMessageRoleEnum.Assistant,
          content: response
        },
        response
      ]
    }
  }
})

```

## Example package.json update

```bash copy
npm rm socialagi soul-engine common-tags
```

```bash copy
npm install --save @opensouls/engine
```

Many souls will have a small dependency set like this;
```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@opensouls/engine": "^0.1.0"
  }
```
