    At Open Souls, we believe that pricing should be simple, transparent, and fair. Our goal is to make the incredible power of AI souls accessible to as many developers and creators as possible.

    We've designed our pricing model with a few key principles in mind:

    1. **Simplicity**: Pricing should be easy to understand. You shouldn't need a PhD to figure out your bill. 

    2. **Transparency**: There should be no hidden fees or surprise charges. What you see is what you get.

    3. **Fairness**: Pricing should scale with usage. Small projects should be affordable, while larger projects can grow without breaking the bank.

## Credits 
Technology evolves rapidly. We require flexibility to provide you with the best experience at the best price. We use a credit system to allow you to pay-per-use and offer you the best prices as we grow. 

### Conversion
During our Alpha, our formula for converting credits to dollars is:
> 1 credit = $1

Simple!

### Usage Calculation
We add a nominal markup to our costs in order to fund continued improvements to our technology. Here's how we calculate credit usage:

- **Model Proxy**: 1x + 0.75% proxy fee
  - We add a 0.75% proxy fee to cover the cost of our model proxy.
  - Otherwise, we pass through the cost of any LLM API call.
- **Storage**: 0.15 credits/gigabtye
  - Storage is cheap! We transfer that savings to our customers.
  - We add a fee to cover the cost of Databases, Backups, and Object Storage.
- **Compute**: 0.0015 credits/second of execution time
- **Data Transfer**
  - **Inbound**: Free
  - **Outbound**: 500MB free, then 0.02 credits/gigabyte
